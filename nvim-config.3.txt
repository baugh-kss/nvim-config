## TUTORIAL 3 - PACKAGER MANAGER & PLUGINS

Welcome back to the exciting world of Neovim customization! In this tutorial, 
we'll take your Neovim configuration to the next level by introducing a 
package manager called Packer and installing a powerful plugin called 
Telescope.nvim for enhanced searching and navigation.

## INSTALLING PACKER

Before we dive into Telescope.nvim, let's set up Packer, a lightweight 
package manager for Neovim.

## INSTALLING PACKER

Packer should already be installed on the school server, but run it just in
case or if you are at home, you will need to run

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```

## CONFIGURE NEOVIM WITH PACKER

Create a new file for packer and your plugins

```
nvim ~/.config/nvim/lua/kwalikum/packer.lua
```

Add the following lines to your packer.lua file:

```
-- setup packer and telescope
vim.cmd [[packadd packer.nvim]]

require('packer').startup(function(use)
        use 'wbthomason/packer.nvim'
        use {
        'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim', tag = '0.1.4',
        requires = { {'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim'} }
        }
end)
```

Save the file and add it to your init.lua:

```space w```
```:Ex```

Navigate to init.lua and add the following line:

```require("kwalikum.packer")```

Save the file and quit neovim.  

```space w```
```:Ex```

Start by opening neovim and it should show some indication that packer is 
installing.  Run the following command to install the Telescope plugin:

```:PackerSync```

When it's done press 'q' to quit packer


## CONFIGURE TELESCOPE PLUGIN

Navigate to the after/plugin directory and press "%" to create a new file
for the telescope plugin called "telescope.lua"

Insert the following lines to configure the telescope plugin:

```
require("telescope").setup {
  defaults = {
    theme = "center",
    sorting_strategy = "ascending",
    layout_config = {
      horizontal = {
        prompt_position = "top",
        preview_width = 0.6,
      },
    },
  },
}
local builtin = require('telescope.builtin')

vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>pf', builtin.find_files, {})
vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>pg', builtin.git_files, {})
vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>pl', builtin.live_grep, {})
vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>ps', function()
	builtin.grep_string({ search = vim.fn.input("grep > ") });

end)
```

This will setup some shortcuts and configure the look of the plugin.

Save the file and source it and quit

```space w```
```space so```
```space q```

## TESTING PACKER AND TELESCOPE PLUGIN

Navigate to ~/.config/nvim and open neovim

```cd ~/.config/nvim```
```neovim```

Test telescope by pressing <leader>pf, if everything is working right
you should see a list of files in your ~/.config/nvim directory. 

This is because you opened neovim within the ~/.config/nvim directory.

If you type in "init..." it should start to show you your 2 init.lua files.
You can search for any file within the ~/.config/nvim directory, when you 
have the file you would like to open selected, press enter to open it.

You can cycle between the options with Control + p and n keys.

Congratulations! You've successfully installed Packer, integrated 
Telescope.nvim into your Neovim setup and customized it with your own
configuration.  Most plugins for neovim work exactly the same way, so you 
basically learned how to install any plug in for neovim. In the next tutorial, 
we'll explore more advanced configurations and plugins to supercharge your 
coding experience. 

Until then, happy coding!
